            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I'm Lee O'Bryan — a civil engineering student from Illinois working at the intersection of technology, design, and the built environment. I build systems that make complex work simpler and more powerful.</p>

            <p>I'm analytical and creative. I see connections between cities, structures, ideas, and the people who build them. I travel to understand how things are made. I learn by building.</p>

            <p>My Catholic faith drives everything I do — building with purpose, serving others, and creating work that reflects a kind of quiet beauty through order and care.</p>

            <h3>What I'm Exploring</h3>

            <p>I'm exploring where AI fits best in construction, civil engineering, and the built world — not as a replacement for human expertise, but as a tool that amplifies what people already do well.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>Bridging the Gap</h4>
                <p>The construction industry is full of knowledge that lives in people's heads, scribbled notes, and years of experience. AI has the potential to capture, organize, and share that knowledge in ways that make it accessible — especially to those who need it most.</p>
            </div>

            <p>My focus is on understanding the real problems people face in the field and finding where technology can genuinely help. That means spending time with contractors, engineers, and builders to learn how they work, what slows them down, and what they actually need.</p>

            <p>A big part of my work is building trust. AI can feel like a black box — people need to understand not just how it works, but why they can trust it. I'm focused on explaining AI systems in ways that make sense, showing the logic behind the decisions, and helping people develop informed confidence in these tools. Teaching isn't just about showing people what to do — it's about building understanding and trust so they can think critically about technology in their work.</p>

            <p>The goal is to bridge the gap between the built world and the digital one, thoughtfully and practically.</p>
