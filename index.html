            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I'm Lee O'Bryan — a civil engineering student from Illinois who's passionate about the intersection of technology, design, and the real world. My work centers on how thoughtful systems and practical innovation can make life and work simpler, clearer, and more human.</p>

            <p>At heart, I'm both analytical and creative. I enjoy thinking deeply about how things connect — from cities and structures to the ideas and people that build them. I like to travel, to learn how things are made, and to make things myself — whether that's writing, tinkering, or cooking from scratch.</p>

            <p>My faith as a Catholic shapes how I approach everything I do — with a sense of purpose, humility, and an aim toward building things that serve others and reflect a kind of quiet beauty in order and care.</p>

            <h3>What I'm Exploring</h3>

            <p>I'm exploring where AI fits best in construction, civil engineering, and the built world — not as a replacement for human expertise, but as a tool that amplifies what people already do well.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>Bridging the Gap</h4>
                <p>The construction industry is full of knowledge that lives in people's heads, scribbled notes, and years of experience. AI has the potential to capture, organize, and share that knowledge in ways that make it accessible — especially to those who need it most.</p>
            </div>

            <p>My focus is on understanding the real problems people face in the field and finding where technology can genuinely help. That means spending time with contractors, engineers, and builders to learn how they work, what slows them down, and what they actually need.</p>

            <p>I'm interested in teaching — not just showing people how to use tools, but helping them understand why those tools matter and how to think critically about technology in their work. The goal is to bridge the gap between the built world and the digital one, thoughtfully and practically.</p>
